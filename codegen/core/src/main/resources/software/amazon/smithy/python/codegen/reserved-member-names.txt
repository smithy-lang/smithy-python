# Python reserved words for members.

# The following are reserved words that can't be used as identifiers at all.
# For example, the following would produce a syntax error:
#
# class Foo:
#     pass: int
#
# A full list of these can be found here:
#
# https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywords
#
# Note that None, True, and False aren't here - members are always lower
# cased, so they'll never match here. Those are in the clas names reserve
# list.

# The following aren't reserved words, but are built-in types / functions that
# would break if you ever tried to refer to the type again in scope. For
# example:
#
# class Foo:
#     str: str
#
#     def __init__(self, str: str):
#         pass
#
# That would have an exception in the definition of __init__ since when you use
# `str` as the type after you've defined `str` in scope, it thinks you're
# referencing `Foo.str` rather than the built-in type (or a type at all).
#
# A listing of these types can be found here:
# https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html
#
# Note though that we only need to escape the types we use.
bool
bytes
bytearray
dict
float
int
list
str

# For the exact same reason as above, these are names of common types
# that are likely imported in the generated code (e.g. datetime)
# We only escape the types we use.
datetime
