This package provides shared utilities for testing functionality in tooling generated by Smithy.

## MockHTTPClient

The `MockHTTPClient` allows you to test smithy-python clients without making actual network calls. It implements the `HTTPClient` interface and provides configurable responses for functional testing.

### Basic Usage                                                                                                                                                                                      

```python                                                                                                                                                                                               
from smithy_testing import MockHTTPClient

# Create mock client and configure responses
mock_client = MockHTTPClient()
mock_client.add_response(
   status=200,
   headers=[("Content-Type", "application/json")],
   body=b'{"message": "success"}'
)

# Use with your smithy-python client
config = Config(transport=mock_client)
client = TestSmithyServiceClient(config=config)

# Test your client logic
result = await client.some_operation({"input": "data"})

# Inspect what requests were made
assert mock_client.call_count == 1
captured_request = mock_client.captured_requests[0]
assert result.message == "success"
```

## Utilities

- `create_test_request()`: Helper for creating test HTTPRequest objects                                                                                                                              
- `MockHTTPClientError`: Exception raised when no responses are queued
